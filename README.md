# SVGD for quantum tomography

## We are using Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) for quantum tomography. 

We did some simulations with SVGD build in PyMC3. In addition, we compare SVGD and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). 
One will find all the information in the notebook called "full-simulations-using-adam.ipynb"

We also have our own code but it has some issues with convergence. 



This project was a collaboration with Prof. Ferrie(UTS)
